# CryptoCurrency
Created a simple static crypto currency conversion rate page to convert from crypto to fiat currency. In this project I worked around with node.js, 
express, using command line, javascript, and DOM manipulation to grab external api data from the internet to use in project. 
Within the project I implemented a basic conversion of crypto to fiat at current time and date. But also implemented a quantity conversion rate, 
where user can put in quantity of crypto currency and convert it to fiat currency.
